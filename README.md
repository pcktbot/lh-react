# lh-react
What is the best way to programmatically call Lighthouse? I am okay in Node, but interacting in the browser is tough.

## install
This is a create-react-app, so you can use Yarn or NPM to install the dependencies. You can either clone or fork this repo using git. Then from within your local directory, run `npm install`. 

It's pretty light. The two most important dependencies are for Lighthouse and Puppeteer.

## still learning react
This is a throw away repo for getting more familiar with React. I am not too keen about Facebook, but I am able to segregate the software for the website from the company itself. 

## dev server
`npm start` will load a development server locally.
`npm run build` or `yarn build` will create a production build that can be deployed to a web server.
